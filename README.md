# tiptap-ruby

This project is an example of how to enable support for the `<ruby>` html tag in [TipTap](https://tiptap.dev/).

## Run

```
npm run serve
```

## Example

The component binds `Mod+u`, for example `CMD+u` key to add a ruby tag. Once added, you can use the editor to modify the furigana as you would expect.
